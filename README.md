# Abstract 
We introduce MMIS, a novel dataset designed to advance the generation and recognition. comprises three distinct modalities image, text, and speech. Each image within the dataset is accompanied by its corresponding textual description and an audio recording of that description, providing rich and diverse sources of information for scene generation and recognition. encompasses a wide range of interior spaces, capturing various styles, layouts, and furnishings. To construct this dataset, we employed careful processes involving the collection of images, generation of textual descriptions, and corresponding speech annotations. The presented dataset contributes to research in multi-modal representation learning tasks such as image generation, retrieval, captioning, and classification.
