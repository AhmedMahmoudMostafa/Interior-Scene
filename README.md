# Abstract 
We introduce MMIS, a novel dataset designed to advance the generation and recognition. comprises three distinct modalities image, text, and speech. Each image within the dataset is accompanied by its corresponding textual description and an audio recording of that description, providing rich and diverse sources of information for scene generation and recognition. encompasses a wide range of interior spaces, capturing various styles, layouts, and furnishings. To construct this dataset, we employed careful processes involving the collection of images, generation of textual descriptions, and corresponding speech annotations. The presented dataset contributes to research in multi-modal representation learning tasks such as image generation, retrieval, captioning, and classification.

# Dataset Taxonomy

The dataset encompasses an extensive taxonomy featuring more than 30 classes, each further divided into specific subclasses such as Living Room, Bedroom, Bathroom, Dining Room, and Kitchen.

## Within each class, you'll find:

- **Image**: A visual representation capturing the essence of the scene.
- **Text Description**: A comprehensive textual narrative providing insights and details about the depicted environment.
- **Audio Narration**: An audio recording accompanying the text description, offering multiple interpretations with up to six distinct voices.

This comprehensive structure allows for a rich exploration of various interior scenes, facilitating research and applications across diverse domains such as scene generation, recognition, and multimodal representation learning.
